Subject: Squid @SQUID_RELEASE@.1 is available


The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-@SQUID_RELEASE@.1 release!


This release is we believe, stable enough for general production use.


Support for Squid-@SQUID_OLD_RELEASE@ bug fixes has now officially ceased. Bugs in @SQUID_OLD_RELEASE@.x
will continue to be fixed, however the fixes will be added to the @SQUID_RELEASE@.x
series. All users of Squid-@SQUID_OLD_RELEASE@.x are encouraged to plan for upgrades.


A short list of the major new features is:

Please remember to run "squid -k parse" when testing upgrade to a new
version of Squid. It will audit your configuration files and report
any identifiable issues the new release will have in your installation
before you "press go".


All feature additions are considered *experimental* until they have
survived at least one series of releases in general production use.
Please be aware of that when rolling out features which are new in
this series. Not all use-cases have been well tested yet and some may
not even have been implemented. Assistance is still needed despite the
releases general stability level.


Plans for the next series of releases is already well underway. Our
future release plan and upcoming features can be found at:
